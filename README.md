# random-password-generator-tkinter-python
Fronted: Python Backend: SQL
In this project, 
I was be building a Graphical User Interface(GUI) Password Random Generator application that will help us manage our passwords easily. 
The passwords will be encrypted and stored in a SQL database. It doesn't rely on any web connection and hence, there will be fewer potential risks.
